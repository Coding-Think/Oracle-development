Be Careful When Using Oracle to Build a Connection with Spring
Here are some problems I encountered during setup. I hope this helps you avoid similar mistakes:

1.
Unknown Spring Version Warning (Yellow Line)
There was a yellow warning line under the version check.
The reason was: I downloaded a pre-configured package that included Java,Spring and Eclipse,
so I had NO IDEA ABOUT MY SPRING VERSION UNLESS I ASKED THE AUTHORITY.

SO, DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!

It’s important to clearly know which version of Spring Boot you are using to avoid compatibility issues.

2.
Some Dependencies Cannot Be Downloaded Automatically (Red Line)
Certain packages like:
•	spring-boot-starter-validation
•	spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
cannot always be downloaded automatically by Maven.
Be careful when you see red error lines in your Eclipse. Check the messages and fix your Maven settings if necessary.

AND AGAIN, DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!

(Luckily, it was on the laptop provided by my company.If it had been my own machine, I definitely would have wiped everything and done a full reset!)

Although my senior and I fixed all the issues we could identify, the database still won't connect. (I’m really frustrated with Oracle!)
ONCE AGAIN! DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!
